note as general
  This diagram outlines the design of all components and
  their interactions within the OpenShift/Kubernetes environment.
  Squares represent pods with a single container running per pod
  (thus, any square can be scaled independently).
  The contents of each pod represent the service running inside the pod.
  Cylinders represent volume mounts that are shared amongst pods.
